                  We recommend storing your cards in protective sleeves and keeping them in a cool, dry place away from
                  direct sunlight. For valuable cards, consider using hard plastic cases or getting them professionally
                  graded and encapsulated.

                <p>
                  Avoid touching the surface of cards with your fingers, as oils from your skin can damage the card over
                  time. Always handle cards by the edges.
